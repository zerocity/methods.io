# Transfection siRNA  

6 well plate ~200 000 cells/well (depends on proloferation kinetics) for transfection 70% confluency

#### 1. Well Plate preperation

For one well:

`vessel 1` 150 µL Optimem + 3 µL siRNA (120 nM) 
    
`tube 2` 40 µL Optimem + 5 µL Oligofectamine (4°C Heidi lab) 

`consider vessel size` consider final volume after solution preparation

#### 2. incubate both 10' room temp

#### 3. currently remove medium
#### 4. wash with PBS (don't remove PBS until transfection will start)

#### 5. After 10' mix tube 1 into tube 2 (not vice versa) by dropping it in slowly

#### 6. Incubate 15' room temp

#### 7. Add 300 µL Optimem (one well!!) to the solution, mix smoothly 1x 

#### 8. remove PBS from wells

#### 9. Add 500 µL ready to use transfection solution to the cells

#### 10. Incubate 4 - 5 h (toss 3 x in between)

#### 11. add 1 mL proper medium/15% FCS (final conc. 10%) use medium without antibiotics (in fridge)!!!

#### 12. Incubate further 24h at least (mRNA level), for decreased protein level 48h
